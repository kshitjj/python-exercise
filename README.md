# python-exercise
## Introduction
hello, my name is kshitij and I am making this repository for myself to upload python projects and work on them instead of just doing something and not exactly getting real work experience. So, yes I am gonna work on my python through this repository I guess.

## Objective
- [ ] - Maintain this repository (basically keep it neat and clean)
- [ ] - Add python projects regularly to this repository
That's about it, I can't think of anymore objectives :-).
