# python-exercise
## Introduction
hello, my name is kshitij and I am making this repository for myself to upload python projects and work on them instead of just doing something and not exactly getting real work experience. So, yes I am gonna work on my python through this repository I guess.

## Objective
- [ ] - Maintain this repository (basically keep it neat and clean)
- [ ] - Add python projects regularly to this repository
That's about it, I can't think of anymore objectives :-).

## Method to "Maintain" a clean and neat repository
### 1. New Folder, New Project
- *Decluttering of the current directory that this README.md resides in*. This process is to make sure I don't clutter up the current directly with file names like "project1.py", this way I will get everything cluttered up.
- *Naming of the Folder descriptively*. I will name the folder which accurately describes the purpose or the objective of the project
### 2. Documentation
- *every folder(project) should have README.md* So, This README.md file is the documentation of the folder/project.
- *Documentation should contain all the libraries used and sources of the problem statement as well.*
- I will make a layout for this project thing as soon as I am done with python tutorial.
### 3. Consistency
- To make sure, I am consistent *I need to work on these projects at fixed time*. I will do the projects *in the morning before college* perhaps(because that way there's no uncertainty). Or I work on the project *after college at around 1630*, Cause at that time I am 100% certain that I don't do any lecture or anything and I can go and talk to everyone in 15 minutes and boom leave.
