# Introduction
Number guessing is a simple game in which the computer generates a random numbers between 1 - 10 or 1 - 100. And then the user must guess the number and i\

# Feature
1. The number is generated by the computer from the range 1 to 100
2. Hint: 
    - a range is given to the user after the first guess of length 20 numbers
    - The hint length decreases by 4 length each time the user guesses.
3. Score System: 
    - If first guess is correct, then 50 points
    - If second guess is corrent, then 40 points

    - If fourth guess is correct, then 20 points
    - If fifth guess is correct, then 10 points
    - After fifth guess you just lose the game.
